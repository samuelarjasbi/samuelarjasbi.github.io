This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process.
We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to improve/add new ideas to this project.
Thank you for helping out and remember, **no contribution is too small.**
Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving suggestions. üèÜ
