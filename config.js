    "about": "I've been passionate about programming since I was 11 years old, and it has been the driving force behind my journey in \nthe technology field. Over the years, I've explored various areas within technology, but my focus has always been on \nprogramming. \n\nMy career started with Java, and I have many fond memories of working with great teams, talented seniors, and creative \njuniors. In 2017, I made the decision to switch to Python, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. As \nI delved deeper into the language, I became particularly interested in the Django framework, and it was then that I realized \nmy calling as a back-end developer. \n\nWith a decade of experience in programming and seven years of professional experience, I know there is always more to \nlearn. I'm eager to join a team of like-minded professionals where I can continue to grow and share my knowledge and \nexpertise.\nIt's been 10 years and now with 6 years of professional experience, I realized I can learn much much more and also share \nmy experience with great teams and as result learn from them and grow.",
